# SMSEventLog

## Install Instructions
1. Download `smseventlog_win.zip` from OneDrive folder. (ask Jayme for link if you don't have it).
2. Extract folder to `C:\Users\your_user_name\smseventlog_win` (eg jgordon)
3. Right click `SMS Event Log.exe` and create a shortcut
4. Right click shortcut file > set shortcut icon > find icon file in `C:\Users\your_user_name\smseventlog_win\data\images\sms_icon.ico` (I'll automate this part eventually)
5. Drag shortcut to taskbar for quick access


### Update
* If you have previously downloaded and extraced the full zip, future updates will usually only require you to download `SMS Event Log.exe` from the `smseventlog_win` folder and replace your existing exe.
